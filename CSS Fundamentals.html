<!-- Lesson 1: Assignments | CSS Fundamentals

Task 1: Use CSS to style the chocolate chip cookie recipe according to the following requirements:

    Apply different font families, sizes, and styles to the recipe title, ingredients, and steps.

    Set the background color of the header and footer.

    Add padding and margin to elements to enhance spacing and layout.

    Create a border around the recipe to separate it from the rest of the page.

    Use different colors for text and background to improve readability.

    Apply hover effects to links within the recipe, such as the recipe source link.

    Utilize class, id, and at least 1 combinator selector when styling your CSS. 

Expected Outcome: Utilize fundamental CSS properties to style recipe and enhance its appearance.

2. Assignment: Creating a Recipe Submission Button and Styled Form

Task 1: Create an HTML file containing a button that links to a separate page for recipe submission. Include elements such as <button> with appropriate attributes and an anchor tag <a> to link to the submission page.

Expected Outcome: Utilize button and anchor tag elements to the page to allow users to navigate to another page for additional functionality.

Task 2: Use CSS to style the button with hover effects using pseudo-classes (:hover). Ensure that the button stands out and invites users to click.

Expected Outcome: Apply CSS pseudo-class styling to add visual appeal and provide additional queues to users.

Task 3: Create a separate HTML file for the recipe submission form. Include form elements such as <form>, <input> fields for recipe name, ingredients, and instructions, and a submit button <button>.

Expected Outcome: Utilize CSS elements for building forms to allow users to submit multiple data to forms. -->
